### Fast and flexible Bayesian species distribution modelling using Gaussian processes

This repository contains the analysis code for the accepted and soon to be published paper:

Golding, N & Purse, B.V. Fast and flexible Bayesian species distribution modelling using Gaussian processes. *Methods in Ecology and Evolution*.

A link to an open-access copy of the paper will appear here soon, as will some instructions for runing the analysis and making the figures in the paper.
